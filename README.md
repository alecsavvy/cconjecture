# three-n-plus-one
A repository for my study of the 3N+1 algorithm 

THE 3N+1 STUDY

The algorithm is currently unexplained but in a nutshell you input any positive integer and if it is odd you multiply it by 3 and add one,
if it is even divide by two.

As you continue this process every integer will be broken down into an endless loop of 4, 2, 1.
No one has figured out quite why this works the way it does but I am curious about it and I will track my studies here
in this repository.

cheers
