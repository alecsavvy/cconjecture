#THE COLLATZ CONJECTURE

A repository for my study of the Collatz Conjecture

The algorithm starts with any positive integer. If it is odd you multiply it by 3 and add 1. If it is even you divide by 2.
As you continuously iterate every integer will resolve to an endless loop of 4, 2, 1.


#python3 code example

        def run(n):
            # n is an int > 0
            while n != 0: 
                # infinite because 0 is unreachable
                if n % 2 != 0:
                    # n is odd
                    n = 3n+1
                    print(n)
                else:
                    # n is even
                    n = n/2
                    print(n)
            return None
        
        
        >>> run(1)  # starting algorithm at 1
        >>> 4       # n = 3(1)+1
        >>> 2       # n = (4)/2
        >>> 1       # n = (2)/2 loop repeats
        >>> 4       # n = 3(1)+1
        >>> 2       # n = (4)/2
        >>> 1       # n = (2)/2 continues infinitely
        >>> quit() 
        
        

No one has figured out why this works but I am curious so I will document my work in this repository. If you want to test this yourself you can run ex.py.


There may be terms that I come up with over the course of this study so I will define them in the following file explanations below.

#main.py
(created: 03/01/2017)

Initializes the entire project with a user interface through the console. As of right now this is built to run from terminal. For you newbies (welcome ;) ), you can run this from idle or any other IDE you're comfortable with.
        
        cd path/cconjecture

Parent: a potential previous node from an integer

Parental Hierarchy: The accumulation of every potential parent node and following parents from a starting integer. For example, 2 has one parent which is 4. This is because 4/2 is 2. If we try to find the other parent for 2 [ 2 = 3n+1 ] we get 1/3 which is not an integer, and therefore not an option. 


#trends.py
(created: 03/06/2017)

Contains all of the proofs for the Collatz Conjecture, or at least the proofs of any trends I find.

#ex.py
(created: 03/01/2017)

Simple example program that asks for an integer if you want to watch the Collatz Conjecture in action.
